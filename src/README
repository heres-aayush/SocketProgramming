Socket Programming - TCP
    The client creates a socket and tries to connect to the server .
    Server creates a Socket OBJECT and connects/interacts with the client

    Steps -
    * Server instantiates ServerSocket (with port number)
    * Server accepts() method of ServerSocket Class .

    # Client instantiates a Server Object specifying server name and port number
    # Constructor of Socket class tries to connect ServerSocket at its accept()  method which is constantly running .

    Both client and Server has InputStream and OutputStream
    client(InputStream) ----> server(OutputStream)
    Server(OutputStream) ----> Client(InputStream)

    The ServerSocket has 4 constructors -
