            Socket Class - socket
            ServerSocket - Server program to listen for clients and establish connection


Socket Programming - TCP
    The client creates a socket and tries to connect to the server .
    Server creates a Socket OBJECT and connects/interacts with the client

    Steps -
    * Server instantiates ServerSocket (with port number)
    * Server accepts() method of ServerSocket Class .

    # Client instantiates a Server Object specifying server name and port number
    # Constructor of Socket class tries to connect ServerSocket at its accept()  method which is constantly running .

    Both client and Server has InputStream and OutputStream
    client(InputStream) ----> server(OutputStream)
    Server(OutputStream) ----> Client(InputStream)

    The ServerSocket has 4 constructors -
        public ServerSocket(int port)throws IOException  - defining the port number
        ServerSocket(int port , int backlog) - backlog specifies how many incoming client to wait for
        ServerSocket(int port , int backlog, InetAddress add) - Inet used for servers having multiple IPs
    The ServerSocket has following methods -
        1. accept() - waits for incoming client
        2. GetLocalPort() - port the server socket is listening to
        3. setSoTimeout() - for how long ServerSocket waits for the client during accept
        4. bind(SocketAddress host, int backlog ) - use this if called the constructor without parameters

    The Socket class (Client) -
    Constructors -
    1. Socket (String host, int port) throws UnknownHostException, IOException
    2. Socket (InetAddress host , int port )
    3. Socket() - creates an unconnected socket . Use the connect function to connect to the server

    Methods -
    1. public void connect(SocketAddress host, int timeout) throws IOException
    2. public InetAddress getInetAddress() ;
    3. public int get port()
    //assume public
    4. SocketAddress getRemoteSocketAddress()
    5. InputStream getInputStream() throws IOException
    6. OutputStream getOutputStream() throws IOE...
    7. public void close()

    InetAddress Class -
    Methods -
    1. static InetAddress getByAddress(byte[] addr) -return object given the raw IP
    2. String toString() - converts the IP address to a string
